      <h1>To My Dearest,</h1>
      <p>
        And even after all I said; after the silence, the space, and the
 letting go—there’s still one truth I didn’t say out loud enough: I will
 always love you. Not in the way that waits by the door or checks the 
phone hoping to see your name. Not in the way that interrupts your life 
or tries to pull you back. But in the quiet, steady way that love 
sometimes stays, even after everything else fades. It’s the kind of love
 that no longer begs to be seen but gently lingers; in songs, in passing
 memories, in quiet nights where I catch myself remembering the way 
things once felt. Even after goodbye, that love didn’t disappear. It 
simply changed its shape. It softened. It became still. It stopped 
reaching outward but never stopped existing. I may no longer reach for 
you, but a part of me still carries what we had, the comfort, the 
laughter, the little things that made the world feel more right when you
 were in it. That doesn’t mean I haven’t moved forward. I am healing. I 
am growing. But healing doesn’t mean forgetting. It means learning how 
to carry something beautiful, even when it’s no longer yours. And 
somewhere deep inside, there's still a small, quiet wish; one I never 
say too loudly—that maybe someday, if the timing is kinder, we’ll find 
our way back to each other. So no matter how far we drift or how 
different our lives become, I hope you know this: I loved you. I still 
do, in my own quiet way. And maybe, I always will. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yours forever,  
        <br><strong>Me</strong>
      </p>
